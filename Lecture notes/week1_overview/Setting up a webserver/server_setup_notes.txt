Change php
<Directory "c:/wamp/apps/phpmyadmin3.4.5/">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride all
        Order Deny,Allow
        Allow from all
</Directory>


2. Skype port 80 problem
if skype is your problem with port 80 you should disable that and let wamp take over 80. in skype: tools->options->advanced->connection uncheck the use port 80 thing. This is a very typical conflict, so forgive me if I am making useless assumptions. 
	 
	
3. Changing root password

http://forum.wampserver.com/read.php?2,44780

If you have never set a password for root, the server does not require a password at all for connecting as root. To setup root password for first time, use command at shell prompt as follows:

mysqladmin -u root password NEWPASSWORD

However, if you want to change (or update) a root password, then you need to use following command

mysqladmin -u root -p oldpassword newpass

Enter password:

Changing password for a user

4. Changing someone else's password

Change MySQL password for other user

To change a normal user password you need to type (let us assume you would like to change password for test):

mysqladmin -u test -p oldpassword newpass

However, if using mysql consol through wamp tray icon, then the command to change password for root is

mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR ‘root’@'localhost’=PASSWORD(’new_password’);
