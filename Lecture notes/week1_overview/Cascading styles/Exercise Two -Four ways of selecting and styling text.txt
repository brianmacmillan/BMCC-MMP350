Exercise Two: Four ways of selecting

CSS has many useful tools to allow you to apply styles to object hierarchies.

1. Create a document called exercise_2.html with the following content

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Simple Cascading Example</title>
    <link href="style_selection.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
	<div id="main">
		<header class="header">Header</header>
		<section>
			<p class=“body-text”>Paragraph One</p>
			<p class=“”>Paragraph Two</p>
			<p class=“”>Paragraph Three</p>
			<p id="last-paragraph" class=“”>Paragraph Four</p>
			<div id="child-container" class="child-text">
				<p class="child-text">Child paragraph</p>
				<div>
					<p id="grandchild" class="child-text quote">Grandchild paragraph</p>
				</div>
			</div>
		</section>
		<footer>Footer</footer>
	</div>
</body>
</html>

2. Create a style sheet called style_selection.css in the same folder as your html document. 

body {color:red;margin:0;padding:0;font-size:12pt;font-family:sans-serif !important;}
#main{margin:10px;}

Save and view the file.

3. Add the following to your css file

section p {color: blue;}

All paragraphs that are children of <section> turn blue.

3. Change the styling as follows:

section > p {color: blue;}

Q: What has happened?
A: Only the immediate children of <section> have the styling applied.

3. Add the following to the bottom of your file:

section p:first-child{color: green;}

Q: Why did 3 paragraphs turn green?
A: Paragraph One, Child Paragraph and Grandchild Paragraph are all first children.


:first-child is known as a psuedo class. There are a number of them including :hover, :before, :after, :first-letter and :first line 

4. Change what you just types as follows:

section > p:first-child{color: green;}

Q: Why did only the first paragraph turn green?

The > operator selects the immediate children of the parent elements <section> and only applies its styling rules to those elements.


5. Add the following
section > p:first-child:first-letter{font-weight:bold}

Notice that pseudo classes can be added together.
