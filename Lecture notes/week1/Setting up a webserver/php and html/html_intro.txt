introduction to html

html is hypertext markup language
It is composed of a series of nested tags contained within a document. The document conforms to a standard called the Document Object Model, or DOM, which is deterined by the W3C committee via negotations with stakeholders including industry groups.

The structure of a basic document is as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- the DOCTYPE is specified at the beginning of your document so your browser knows the type of document contained in the file. For HTML 5 you simply specify !Doctyp
<head>
<!-- the comment tag is an angle bracket followed by 
<!-- head is the place where external files are loaded, for example javascript files for programming and css files for formating.
head is also where meta tags go.
-->
</head>
<style>
<!-- a style block contain formatings instructions for elements and tags -->
div{margin:auto;}
.red{color:red;}
.invisible{display:none;}
</style>
<script>
// Script blocks contain scripts that can execute within your browser and manipulate DOM elements and the data they contain.
// By default scripts in an HTML 5 document are interpreted as javascript
// that is why the comment character is the // as opposed to HTML which uses  <!-- --> for comments
function hide(e){
	e.classList.add("invisible");
}
function show(e){
	e.classList.remove("invisible");
}
function showHTML(e){
	alert("The innerHTML property of this element is "+e.innerHTML);
}

</script>
<body>
	<!-- body contains your main document -->
	<!-- documents are comprised of elements, which contain data and attributes -->
	<!-- most elements contain a starting tag and a closing/ending tag
	<!-- the space between a starting and closing tag can contain display text or other ( elements. The text
	is often referred to as the innerHTML property of the element. An element contained within an element is consider nested.  -->
	<div><span onclick="showInnerHtml(this);">This innerHTML property is contained with a span element nested within a div element </span</div>
	
	<div>Divs can contain blocks of elements.</div>
	<div>The space between div opening and closing info can contain text.This text will display in a browser and is the innerHTML property of the div element</div>
	<div>Spans contain inline elements</div><div>Second inline element</div>
	<table>
		<th><td>table header</td></th>
		<tr><td>TR element contains rows.</td><td>tds are cells</td></tr>
	</table>
	<!-- entities are used to display characters that are part of html markup for example angle brackets and ampersands &amp; and quotes &quot;
	entities can also be used to display foreign language characters -->
	<!-- elements can contain attributes that have special characteristics. The id and name attributes are used to uniquely identify an element. The class attribute is used to format it. -->
	<div class='red'>The class attribute contains formating instructions that are interpreted by a style sheet to alter the display (rendering) of the html document</div>
	<div><span id='test-element'>Elements have events like onclick</span><span onclick="hide('test-element')">Hide</span><span onclick="show('test-element');">Show</span></div>
</body>
