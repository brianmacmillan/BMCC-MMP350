<!-- TC drug warrior - family values candidate by day, drug warrior by night. 
	Mr. Cruz, the NSA warrantless wiretap program just identified a poor woman who is trying to get fertility counselling.
	As a consevative who supports our family values, I can't possibly countenance a poor person trying to get pregnant.
	call x. I think we've got an opportunity to fabricate a documentary here. To camera: you think these poor people would show some dignity and marry rich.
	 That night
	 Mr. Cruz, the NSA warrantless wiretap program has just identified a man smoking marijuana in his own home and harming no one. 
	 As a conservative who supports consitutional protection against unwarranted search and seizures, I can't countenance this. Give me the phone.
	 What do you mena we don't have any rocket launchers.
	 All our rockets were used to level a housing project yesterday ...

	  ... And.. ?
	  	We found some rolling papers, so we used civil forfeiture laws to seize everyone's property. The operation turned a profit.
	  	Good work, our founding fathers would be proud.
