Notes on Nancy's presentation - Eyebeam lecture
Design through prototyping (I agree)
What would a non-linear workflow look like?
The role of prototypings - problem finding as well as problem solving

object, process interaction and experience
issues: time, energy, 

imbed an exchange of properties

Map emotions

Getting away from software and using hands to create virtual spaces. Interesting point, in terms of possible futures of software development.

"installation would "learn" - was intelligence involved or just calibrated feebback???

Mapping the invisible

The anatomy of a prototype

Making form instead of ...?

Goal of her workshop was not a design problem bt to define a formal representation criteria, basically a prototype taxonomy.
- prototype outside in, prototype in action, prototype inside out

Very important to present designs to audience for assessment and review

Body as interface and mobile computing - other set of projects.
Idea of both blocking and enhancing  

Dynamic mapping - 

Not fetishizing or accessorizing - imbedding
